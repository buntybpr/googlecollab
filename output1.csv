3,little do they know the power within . . .,Neutral,0.9993240833282471
4,"going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance .",Neutral,0.993415117263794
5,"we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout .",Neutral,0.8999965786933899
6,"here , it's just "" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots "" .",Neutral,0.999966025352478
7,"the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .",Negative,0.9972807168960571
8,you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 .,Neutral,0.9999778270721436
9,"sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course .",Neutral,0.9999687671661377
10,"the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain .",Neutral,0.982149064540863
11,"so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie .",Neutral,0.9999839067459106
12,"otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .",Neutral,0.9999840259552002
13,""" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .",Neutral,0.999962329864502

17,"from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .",Neutral,0.9968357682228088
18,"right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .",Neutral,0.9239265322685242
19,"perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie .",Neutral,0.9993374943733215
20,"he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .",Neutral,0.9999972581863403
21,"unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .",Negative,0.9940701127052307
22,"until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .",Neutral,0.9999637603759766
23,"he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .",Neutral,0.9363263845443726
24,he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .,Neutral,0.9999532699584961

26,"the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .",Neutral,0.8023941516876221
27,"brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .",Neutral,0.9999936819076538
28,"hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .",Neutral,0.8908565044403076

30,"the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .",Neutral,0.9999980926513672
31,""" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .",Positive,0.999977707862854
32,"it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .",Neutral,0.9950047135353088
33,"even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .",Neutral,0.9970496892929077
34,"although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .",Negative,0.7487844228744507
35,"the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .",Positive,0.7621936202049255
36,"scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .",Neutral,0.9999946355819702
37,"nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .",Positive,0.9978596568107605
38,scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .,Neutral,0.9363736510276794

40,"dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .",Positive,0.8945886492729187
41,"however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .",Positive,0.9999028444290161
42,"bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .",Neutral,0.9999326467514038
43,"he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .",Neutral,0.9986510872840881
44,"however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .",Neutral,0.9996433258056641
45,quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .,Neutral,0.9999966621398926

47,"his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .",Neutral,0.9998676776885986
48,"shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .",Positive,1.0
49,"of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .",Negative,0.8835530281066895
50,"a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .",Negative,0.9970705509185791
51,"every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .",Neutral,0.9958831071853638
52,"the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .",Neutral,0.9999998807907104
53,"many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .",Negative,0.9999120235443115
54,"but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .",Negative,0.9783934950828552
